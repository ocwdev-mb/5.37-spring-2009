Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lecture: 2 sessions over 4 weeks, 1 hour / session

Labs: 2 sessions / week, 4 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

5.13 Organic Chemistry II

Overview
--------

This course provides students with a research-inspired laboratory experience in which students carry out a short synthetic sequence including a catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reaction. The experiment provides students with experience with a variety of advanced techniques for carrying out organic reactions including the use of air-sensitive reagents, distillation, recrystallization, and column chromatography. Analytical techniques include the use of chiral GC for determination of enantiomeric purity.

The key reaction in the experiment is the asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction of cylcopentadience with methacrolein. In principle four stereoisomeric \[4+2\] cycloaddition products can result from this reaction, so both diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity are involved in determining the outcome of the reaction.

{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Set up esterification of dibenzyl tartrate with 2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride which then runs overnight at reflux. The teaching assistants will turn off the heat the following day for you and the reaction will be allowed to proceed at room temperature until the next laboratory period of your group.

{{< tdopen >}}
Filter and concentrate the hydrogenolysis reaction mixture, and set up overnight drying of the diacid product under vacuum. The measurement of the melting point of the product and NMR analysis can be performed either at the beginning of Day 7 or on an "off day" for your group between Days 6 and 7.
